# /etc/inputrc: initialization file for readline
#
# For more information on how this file works, please see the
# INITIALIZATION FILE section of the readline(3) man page
#
# Quick dirty little note:
#  To get the key sequence for binding, you can abuse bash.
#  While running bash, hit CTRL+V, and then type the key sequence.
#  So, typing 'ALT + left arrow' in Konsole gets you back:
#    ^[[1;3D
#  The readline entry to make this skip back a word will then be:
#    "\e[1;3D" backward-word
#

# do not bell on tab-completion
#set bell-style none
set bell-style visible

set meta-flag on
set input-meta on
set convert-meta off
set output-meta on

# Completed names which are symbolic links to
# directories have a slash appended.
set mark-symlinked-directories on
